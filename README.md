# Character Level Named Entity Recognition using RNNs

We train a recurrent neural network (an LSTM) from scratch to classify characters that belong to different entities. Specifically, we leverage named entity recognition (NER) to classify delimiter characters in log data. Delimiters are characters that act as separators, similar to punctuation marks in natural language.
